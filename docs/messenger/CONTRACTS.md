# Messenger Channel — Frozen Contracts (M0)

**Program:** Messenger Channel Experience — plan at picasso repo `docs/roadmap/MESSENGER_CHANNEL_EXPERIENCE.md` (§5 is the contract index; this file is the authoritative text).
**Frozen:** 2026-07-13 (M0), against lambda repo `origin/main@43bbdea`. Each contract carries its own version stamp.
**Vocabulary:** "Messenger" = Facebook Messenger + Instagram DM together. "FB" / "IG" where they differ.

**Amendment rule:** these contracts are FROZEN. A change is an M0-amendment PR to this file, reviewed by tech-lead-reviewer, with every named consumer subphase checked for impact. C1 amendments must be additive-only and observe the webhook-deploys-first rule (C1 §Deploy ordering). In-place edits without an amendment PR are prohibited.

**Schema discipline (applies to every contract):** every reader tolerates missing fields (CLAUDE.md Schema Discipline). New fields are additive; old-shape records must never crash a reader. PRs that add fields to a stored shape add an old-shape fixture test in the same PR.

## C1 — Invoke payload v2 · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M1a (implements), M1b, M3b, M4, M6b, M-Ha.

The payload `Meta_Webhook_Handler` sends via async `InvokeCommand` to `Meta_Response_Processor` (`Meta_Webhook_Handler/index.js:407-416` today).

### v1 fields (frozen forever — names, types, and semantics byte-preserved)

```js
{
  psid:        string,        // sender PSID (FB) / IGSID (IG)
  messageText: string|null,   // message.text, or postback.payload for postbacks
  pageId:      string,        // entry.id
  tenantId:    string,
  tenantHash:  string,
  channelType: 'messenger' | 'instagram',
  messageMid:  string|null,   // message.mid, or synthetic `postback_{psid}_{ts}` for postbacks
  isPostback:  boolean,
}
```

### v2 additions (all additive; absent ⇒ reader treats as v1)

```js
{
  v: 2,                        // payload schema version marker
  eventKind: 'text' | 'postback' | 'quick_reply' | 'attachment' | 'sticker'
           | 'edit' | 'delete' | 'echo' | 'unsupported',
           // standby-ness is NOT an eventKind — it rides the isStandby flag (v1.1)
  timestamp: number,           // Meta messaging[].timestamp (epoch ms) — REQUIRED in every v2 payload
  quickReplyPayload: string|null,  // message.quick_reply.payload (C3 namespace); null unless eventKind='quick_reply'
  appId: string|null,          // message.app_id where Meta provides it (echoes); else null
  attachmentTypes: string[],   // attachment `type` values only (image|video|audio|file|sticker|…) — NO urls/content (PII minimization)
  targetMid: string|null,      // the mid being edited/deleted; only for eventKind edit|delete
  editedText: string|null,     // new text for eventKind='edit'; else null
  isStandby: boolean,          // true when delivered on the standby channel (Conversation Routing)
  replyTo: { mid?: string, storyUrl?: string } | null,  // IG story replies / reply-to context (research 03); else null
}
```

**`psid` inversion on echoes:** Meta inverts sender/recipient on echo events — the business's own account is `sender.id`, the customer is `recipient.id` (research report 04, IG echo marker). For `eventKind:'echo'` (main or standby channel), **`psid` MUST be read from `recipient.id`**, so the session key `meta:{pageId}:{psid}` stays the customer's conversation. For every other kind, `psid` = `sender.id` as today.

**Echo `messageText` is ALWAYS null (v1.1, loop guard):** echoes carry `message.text` (our own bot reply), and a processor that reads it as a user turn would answer it — bot answering itself, an infinite loop. This is not hypothetical: the *legacy* processor treats any non-empty `messageText` as a user message, so forwarding echo text during the M1a→M1b deploy gap would loop live. The webhook therefore never populates `messageText` on echo payloads; M6b's pause logic needs only `psid`/`appId`/`timestamp`. (Also PII minimization — no need to re-ship reply text.)

**`timestamp` fallback (v1.1):** when Meta omits `messaging[].timestamp` on an event shape, the webhook stamps receipt time (`Date.now()`), so `timestamp` is present in every v2 payload as required. Receipt time is conservative for the 24h send-window guard (never older than the true event time).

### Classification rules (webhook side, M1a)

- `quick_reply` tap ⇒ `eventKind:'quick_reply'`, `messageText` = `message.text` (v1-compatible), `quickReplyPayload` = the payload. (QR taps arrive as `messages`, NOT postbacks — research report 01 §2.)
- Attachment-only message ⇒ `eventKind:'attachment'`, `messageText:null`, `attachmentTypes` populated. Text+attachment ⇒ `eventKind:'text'` with `attachmentTypes` populated.
- `message.is_echo` ⇒ `eventKind:'echo'`, `appId` populated, never invokes Bedrock (consumer: M6b pause logic).
- Standby-channel events ⇒ same classification with `isStandby:true`.
- Sticker: both pre- and post-Aug-30-2026 webhook shapes classify to `eventKind:'sticker'` (migration: sticker becomes an attachment `type` — M1a fixtures carry both shapes; the pre-migration shape already includes `sticker` in `attachmentTypes`, so one check covers both).
- IG story replies classify as their underlying kind (usually `text`) with `replyTo` populated.
- **Metadata-only events ⇒ logged intentional skip** (no invoke, no fallback reply — these carry no user input to answer): reactions, delivery/read receipts, standalone `messaging_referrals`, `response_feedback`. (Referral `ref`-param handling is a future additive amendment, not `unsupported`-fallback territory.)
- Anything else that DOES carry user input ⇒ `eventKind:'unsupported'` — invoked, never silently dropped (30-second rule, research report 02 §1).

### Deploy ordering (the rule that makes split PRs safe)

1. **Webhook deploys first.** Always. The processor is never updated to require a v2 field before the webhook ships it.
2. **Legacy-gap behavior is verified safe:** the current processor's `validateEvent` (`Meta_Response_Processor/index.js:656-663`) throws on empty `messageText` and the handler drops without retry — so v2 payloads for new event kinds (`messageText:null`) hitting the legacy processor produce a logged drop, identical to today's webhook-side drop. No crash, no regression. M1b then adds the real handling.
3. `timestamp` activates the processor's existing dormant 24h guard (`index.js:712`) immediately on M1a deploy — intended (stale-DLQ protection is the guard's purpose).
4. v1-shape contract fixtures live in BOTH functions' test suites; a change that breaks a v1 fixture fails CI.

## C2 — `messenger_behavior` config section + gating hierarchy · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M1b, M3a, M5, M6a. Types land in CB repo `src/types/config.ts` (M0).

### The three gates (all must pass for Messenger behavior to run)

| Gate | Where | Meaning | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Connection | DDB `picasso-channel-mappings` item attr `enabled` (per page+channel) | this Page/IG account is connected & on | **Runtime-authoritative.** The webhook consults it (`Meta_Webhook_Handler/index.js:383`). Any `enabled` mirror inside S3 config (`channels.*.enabled`) is display-only for Config Builder; no sync is guaranteed; **no runtime code may ever read the S3 mirror for gating.** |
| 2. Tenant behavior flag | S3 config `feature_flags.MESSENGER_CHANNEL` | tenant is opted into the new Messenger experience (V5, CTAs, forms, …) | Flag name **finalized here: `MESSENGER_CHANNEL`**. Flag off ⇒ processor behavior byte-identical to the pre-program baseline (M1b/M3b contract tests). |
| 3. Tuning | S3 config `messenger_behavior` (top-level key) | how the experience behaves | All fields optional; missing section ⇒ built-in defaults. |

`messenger_behavior` is deliberately **NOT** under `channels` — `channels.*` is OAuth-connection state written by `Meta_OAuth_Handler`; two writers on one key is clobber risk (plan §4 D1).

### Section shape (v1 — all fields optional, additive evolution only)

```ts
interface MessengerBehaviorConfig {
  tone_override?: string;        // replaces config.tone_prompt in the Messenger prompt when set (C6)
  model_id?: string;             // Messenger model override (C6 precedence)
  max_history_turns?: number;    // default 5 (processor MAX_HISTORY_TURNS)
  strings?: MessengerStrings;    // ALL user-facing strings (D10 — Spanish i18n localizes by config)
  escalation_email?: string;     // staff notification recipient for "talk to a human" (M6a); absent ⇒ email step skipped, transfer + pause still proceed
  welcome?: MessengerWelcomeConfig;      // M5: ice breakers (≤4) + persistent menu source
  channel_overrides?: {          // per-channel deltas; same shape, applied last (C6)
    messenger?: MessengerChannelOverride;
    instagram?: MessengerChannelOverride;
  };
}

interface MessengerStrings {
  disclosure_line?: string;          // sent on first turn of a session (M1b; bot-disclosure rule)
  unsupported_input_fallback?: string; // reply to attachment/sticker/voice we can't process (M1b; 30s rule)
  escalation_confirmation?: string;  // "connecting you with a person…" (M6a)
  rate_limited?: string;             // polite throttle message (M-Hb)
  form_summary_intro?: string;       // generic form-flow strings (M7a); field prompts stay in conversational_forms
  [key: string]: string | undefined; // additive strings without a type change
}

interface MessengerChannelOverride {
  tone_override?: string;
  model_id?: string;
  strings?: MessengerStrings;
}

interface MessengerWelcomeConfig {
  ice_breakers?: Array<{ question: string; payload: string }>; // ≤4 (C5); payload in C3 namespace
  persistent_menu?: Array<{ title: string; payload?: string; url?: string }>; // title ≤20 chars wisdom applies per C5 refs
}
```

Defaults for every string live in code; config overrides them. Readers use `config.messenger_behavior?.field ?? default` — never bracket access.

## C3 — Structured payload namespace · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M4, M5, M7a.

Format for every postback payload and quick-reply payload Picasso emits (Meta cap: 1000 chars — research report 01):

```
PIC1:<route>:<arg1>[:<arg2>…]
```

- `PIC1` = namespace + version. Future format changes bump to `PIC2`; parsers route on the prefix.
- Args are colon-delimited; args containing `:` are prohibited (route designers pick safe ids); no JSON (keeps payloads short and log-greppable).

### v1 routes

| Route | Shape | Emitted by | Handled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cta` | `PIC1:cta:{ctaId}` | CTA quick replies / ice breakers (M4, M5) | processor: execute the CTA (send_query text, etc.) |
| `ffld` | `PIC1:ffld:{formId}:{fieldKey}:{optionValue}` | form enum quick replies (M7a) | form engine: record answer |
| `fctl` | `PIC1:fctl:{formId}:{op}` where op ∈ confirm\|cancel | form summary/confirm QRs (M7a) | form engine |
| `sched` | `PIC1:sched:{op}:{arg}` (ops defined in M8a, e.g. `slot:{slotId}`) | scheduling QRs/carousel (M8a) | scheduling driver |

### Preserved behaviors (frozen)

- `GET_STARTED` (Meta's conventional get-started postback) is preserved as-is — NOT migrated into the namespace (`Meta_Response_Processor/index.js:782` handles it today).
- **Unknown-payload → RAG:** any payload not matching `PIC1:` (or `GET_STARTED`) is treated as free text into the normal RAG turn — today's behavior for all postbacks, and the forward-compat path for stale buttons after a format bump.

## C4 — `picasso-conversation-state` table schema · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M1c (provisions), M6a, M7a, M8a, M-Hb.

- **Table:** `picasso-conversation-state` — bare name (account = environment; CLAUDE.md naming rule). On-demand billing. Provisioned by Terraform in the picasso repo (M1c) with per-function IAM (never shared roles).
- **PK** `sessionId` (S) — for Messenger: `meta:{pageId}:{psid}` (matches the history-table namespace). Other channels may adopt the table later with their own id shapes.
- **SK** `stateType` (S).
- **TTL attribute: `expires_at`** (N, epoch **seconds**) — named here to kill the `ttl`-vs-`expires_at` bug class (plan §3 fact 6). Every row MUST set it.

### Common attributes (every row)

```
sessionId (S), stateType (S), expires_at (N, epoch s), updated_at (N, epoch ms), schema_version (N) = 1
```

### Row shapes (readers tolerate missing fields; writers may add fields additively)

| stateType | Attributes (beyond common) | Written by | TTL guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lock` | `owner` (S, Lambda request id), `acquired_at` (N ms), `pending` (L of M: `{timestamp (N), mid (S), text (S, absent for non-text kinds), eventKind (S, optional), quickReplyPayload (S, optional), attachmentTypes (L, optional)}`) | M1c serialization (C7) | lock TTL invariant in C7 |
| `pause` | `reason` (S: `escalation`\|`echo_watch`), `paused_at` (N ms) | M6a/M6b | 24 h (thread-control idle expiry) |
| `form_session` | `form_id` (S), `current_field` (S), `answers` (M), `started_at` (N ms) | M7a | idle TTL decided in M7a (G-P3); contract fixes only the attr names |
| `scheduling_session` | `program_id` (S), `stage` (S), `selected_slot` (M), `contact` (M) | M8a | decided in M8a (G-P4) |
| `counters` | `window_start` (N ms), `turn_count` (N) | M-Hb throttles | window-sized |

New stateTypes are additive (no amendment needed); changing an existing row shape IS an amendment.

**PII note:** `answers` / `contact` hold user PII → the table is a PII surface; M1c updates `pii-inventory.md` + data-classification in the same PR (Living-Inventory rule), and TTLs are the retention mechanism.

## C5 — Capability map · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M1b, M3a, M4. Source: research pack (`Facebook/messenger-research-2026-07/`, reports 01–03), July 2026.

| Capability | FB Messenger | Instagram DM |
|---|---|---|
| Message text cap | **2000 chars** | **1000 chars** |
| Quick replies | ≤ **13**, title ≤ **20 chars** (distinct from message caps), transient (vanish after next message) | same |
| `user_email` / `user_phone_number` quick replies | FB only | **not available** |
| Button template | ≤ **3** buttons, persistent in thread | same; structured templates **invisible on IG web** — verify in-app (M4) |
| Carousel (generic template) | ≤ **10** cards | same |
| Postback / QR payload size | ≤ 1000 chars | same |
| Typing indicator (`sender_action`) | supported (refresh ≤ ~10 s intervals) | **no-op** (processor `index.js:405` today) |
| Ice breakers | ≤ **4**, alive (Messenger Profile API) | ≤ 4, alive |
| Persistent menu | yes (menu tap **opens a fresh 24h window**) | yes |
| Inbound GIF/sticker webhook | fires | **fires NO webhook at all** |
| Message edit/delete webhooks | `message_edits` / `message_deletions` (subscribe — M1a runbook) | `message_edit`; `is_deleted` ⇒ Meta terms **require deleting stored copies** (M1b) |
| Post-window lanes | Utility templates / HUMAN_AGENT (App-Review-gated) / OTN | **NONE in the US** ⇒ IG bookings REQUIRE phone; SMS is the reminder rail (D9) |
| Sticker webhook migration | `sticker` attachment type from **Aug 30 2026** — M1a fixtures carry both shapes | same |

Rendering code reads caps from a single shared constant module (created in M1b), never inline literals.

---

## C6 — Prompt precedence · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M3a.

Layers, lowest → highest; each layer overrides only the fields it sets:

1. **Code-owned Messenger base prompt** (M3a module): brevity/format rules (short-form, no markdown, ≤3 sentences), V5 splice points. **Not tenant-overridable** — locked rules stay locked.
2. `config.tone_prompt` — tenant persona (exactly as today, `buildMessengerPrompt` `index.js:548`).
3. `messenger_behavior.tone_override` — **replaces** `tone_prompt` in the Messenger prompt when set (replace, not concatenate).
4. `messenger_behavior.channel_overrides.{messenger|instagram}.tone_override` — replaces again, per channel.

V5 blocks (action catalog, turn check, tail instruction — `shared/prompt/` after M2) are spliced by code and are never part of the override surface.

**`model_id` precedence** (highest wins): `channel_overrides.{ch}.model_id` → `messenger_behavior.model_id` → `config.model_id` (today's only override, `index.js:588`) → processor `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` (`index.js:75`).

---

## C7 — Per-conversation serialization · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M1c (implements), M7a. Scope: per `sessionId` only — distinct sessions are never serialized against each other.

**Problem:** the webhook async-invokes one processor per inbound message; rapid-fire messages on one conversation run concurrently ⇒ interleaved replies, history read/write races, doubled Bedrock spend. The widget serializes naturally (one client, sequential requests); Messenger doesn't.

**Decision: single-writer lock + coalesced pending queue.** (Not drop, not wait.)

Why the alternatives lose (adversarial-pass evidence, not vibes):
- **Drop the loser** — violates the 30-second/no-silent-drop rule (C1); user input vanishes.
- **Wait/retry the loser** — burns a concurrent Lambda for the full turn (2–10 s Bedrock); N rapid messages ⇒ N−1 idle executions AND still N separate Bedrock calls racing history. Costs more and fixes nothing.
- **Lock + coalesce** — loser does one cheap conditional write and exits; winner answers all pending input in one combined turn. One Bedrock call per burst, coherent history, no lost input.

Mechanism (row shape in C4 `lock`):
1. **Acquire:** conditional `PutItem` of the `lock` row — succeeds iff `attribute_not_exists(sessionId)` OR `expires_at < now` (stale-lock takeover). Winner proceeds to the turn.
2. **Coalesce:** loser conditionally appends its pending item (C4 shape — carries the v2 fields, so non-text kinds coalesce too) to the winner's `pending` list and exits (never calls Bedrock). If the append races a lock delete (winner just finished), the loser retries acquisition once — then proceeds as a winner.
3. **Drain:** after sending its reply, the winner re-reads the lock row; if `pending` non-empty, it consumes ALL pending items in timestamp order as one drain cycle: structured members (`quick_reply` with a `PIC1:` payload) route via their C3 handlers individually; free-text members are newline-joined into ONE combined user turn (one Bedrock call); non-text unsupported members contribute a single deduped `unsupported_input_fallback` reply.
4. **Release is CONDITIONAL — never drop-on-release:** delete the lock row gated on `pending` being empty (`attribute_not_exists(pending) OR size(pending) = 0`). If the condition fails (a loser appended between drain-check and delete), that is another drain cycle — go to step 3.
5. **Drain cap bounds spend, not delivery:** at most **3 Bedrock-calling drain cycles** per lock hold. Cycles beyond the cap still consume `pending` (no-drop) but reply with the C2 `rate_limited` string instead of calling Bedrock — bounded cost, every message still answered. Sustained flood beyond that is M-Hb throttle territory.
6. **Lock TTL invariant:** lock TTL **≥ processor function timeout + 10 s margin** (function timeout is 120 s today — picasso repo `infra/modules/lambda-meta-staging/main.tf`; so lock TTL ≥ 130 s). The TTL and the function timeout are coupled: **raising the function timeout requires amending this contract** and the lock-module constant together, or a legitimately-running turn can have its lock stolen mid-processing. `expires_at`-based takeover (step 1) is the crash-recovery path.

Exact conditional expressions, retry jitter, and metrics are M1c implementation detail; frozen here: the mechanism (lock+coalesce), the row shape (C4), the no-drop guarantee (incl. conditional release), the drain semantics and cap, the TTL invariant, and per-sessionId scope.

**v1.1 (M6a):** one sanctioned exception to no-drop — once an escalation's pause row is written (staff now owns the thread), pending items already coalesced onto that same lock hold are claimed and silently discarded with no bot reply. This does not violate no-drop: the messages themselves already reached Meta's inbox (visible to staff there); only the bot's reply is intentionally withheld, because replying would contradict the escalation confirmation just sent.

---

## C8 — Session-boundary definition · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M3a, M3b.

**Problem (G4):** Messenger threads are endless. V5's TURN-CHECK counts assistant questions over the whole history passed to it (`prompt_v5.js:127`) — unscoped, the funnel rules misfire forever after the bot's second-ever question.

**Definition:** a **session** is a maximal run of consecutive messages in the conversation history (`picasso-recent-messages`, `sessionId = meta:{pageId}:{psid}`) where the gap between consecutive `messageTimestamp` values (epoch ms, the table SK) is **< 86,400,000 ms (24 h)**. A gap **≥ 86,400,000 ms ⇒ new session** (boundary sits before the later message).

Rules:
- **History windowing:** the prompt receives only messages after the most recent boundary (capped by `max_history_turns`).
- **TURN-CHECK counting + sustained-interest evaluation:** current session only, never the lifetime thread.
- **Clock:** boundaries are computed from stored `messageTimestamp` write-times (one consistent clock — ours). The Meta event `timestamp` (C1) is for the 24h **send-window** guard, a separate concern; the two are never mixed.
- **Disclosure line** (C2 strings): sent on the first turn of each session, not only the first turn ever.
- **Edge cases:** exactly 86,400,000 ms ⇒ new session (≥ semantics); empty history ⇒ new session; the boundary check runs on history as-read (post-TTL-expiry rows simply absent — consistent with M1b's 7-day TTL, which can only shorten history, never bridge a gap).

---

## C9 — CTA rendering map + free-text fallback · v1.0 (2026-07-13)

**Consumed by:** M4 (implements — by name, no re-derivation), M7a, M8a.

| CTA shape | Renders as | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `send_query` / LEARN-intent suggestions | **Quick replies** (≤13, titles truncated to 20 chars per C5) | transient suggestion — matches QR transience |
| `external_link`, `start_form` (interim link-out until M7), commitment intents (APPLY / SCHEDULE) | **Button template `web_url` buttons** (≤3, persistent) | commitment CTAs must survive in the thread |
| >3 commitment CTAs in one turn | top 3 in V5-returned order; rest dropped (logged) | C5 hard cap |
| Form enum options (M7a) | quick replies with `PIC1:ffld:` payloads | |
| Scheduling slots (M8a) | carousel, ≤10 cards | C5 |

Attachment rule: renderings attach to the **same turn's send sequence** (no cross-turn state); QR set and buttons come from the turn's validated `actionIds` (`validateActionIds`, cap 4, `prompt_v5.js:191`). **Split-reply rule:** when the reply text is split across N Send API calls (C5 char caps), quick replies attach to the **final text chunk**; a button template is sent as its own message **after** the final text chunk (it is structurally a separate message). Nothing renders on intermediate chunks.

**Free-text-fallback principle (frozen):** every tap-driven flow MUST also accept the equivalent typed text — quick replies are skippable and vanish after the next message. A tap is an accelerator, never the only path. Every M4/M7/M8 flow ships a free-text-path test to CI.

**Mixed-turn placement (v1.1, M4 implementation finding):** Meta displays quick replies only on the MOST RECENT message. When a turn renders BOTH quick replies and a button template, the split-reply rule above would strand the QRs on the second-to-last message — so quick replies attach to the turn's LAST message: the final text chunk when no buttons exist, the button template message when they do. Also clarified: `show_info` CTAs are suggestion-class (quick replies), same as `send_query` — both resolve to a free-text turn on tap (C3 `cta` route: send_query → `query`, show_info → `prompt`).

## Version log

| Date | Change | PR |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-13 | C1–C9 v1.0 frozen (M0), after tech-lead-reviewer adversarial pass — 3 blocking + 4 should-fix findings applied pre-freeze (echo `psid` inversion; C7 conditional release + drain semantics + TTL invariant; C4 pending shape carries v2 fields; metadata-only-event skip rule; `replyTo` context; C9 split-reply rule) | lambda#433 |
| 2026-07-13 | **C1 → v1.1** (M1a implementation findings, additive clarifications): echo `messageText` always null (loop guard — legacy processor would answer our own echoed replies during the deploy gap); `timestamp` falls back to receipt time when Meta omits it; `'standby'` removed from the eventKind enum (standby-ness rides `isStandby`, matching the prose rule); NOTE for M1b: edit/delete bypass webhook dedup, so Meta redeliveries double-invoke — processor edit/delete handling MUST be idempotent | (M1a PR) |
| 2026-07-13 | **C9 → v1.1** (M4 implementation finding): mixed-turn placement — quick replies attach to the turn's LAST message (button template when present; Meta shows QRs only on the most recent message); `show_info` classified suggestion-class alongside `send_query` | lambda M4 PR |
| 2026-07-13 | **C2 → v1.1**: additive `escalation_email` field (M6a) — staff-notification recipient for the "talk to a human" escalation path; absent ⇒ SES step skipped, thread-control handoff + pause row still proceed (G-P2 advisory: recipient/content never logged; email body is content-free — channel/tenant/page/timestamp + inbox deep link only, no psid/session id/message text) | lambda M6a PR |
| 2026-07-13 | **C7 → v1.1 (M6a): sanctioned silent-drain exception during escalation** — once an escalation's pause row is written, pending items already coalesced onto that lock hold are claimed and silently discarded with no bot reply; not a no-drop violation (the messages already reached Meta's inbox, visible to staff there — only the bot's reply is withheld) | lambda M6a PR |
