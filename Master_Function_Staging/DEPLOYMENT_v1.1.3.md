# Master_Function_Staging Deployment v1.1.3

**Deployment Date:** 2025-10-26
**Lambda Version:** 9
**Status:** ✅ Deployed Successfully

## Overview

This deployment synchronizes the Bedrock prompt between Master_Function_Staging and Bedrock_Streaming_Handler_Staging to ensure consistent CTA-free responses across both HTTP fallback and streaming endpoints.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- `bedrock_handler.py` (lines 113-144)

### Prompt Updates

**Replaced Old Instructions:**
```python
ESSENTIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Answer the user's question using only the information from the knowledge base results below
- Use the previous conversation context to provide personalized and coherent responses
- Include ALL contact information exactly as it appears: phone numbers, email addresses, websites, and links
- PRESERVE ALL MARKDOWN FORMATTING: If you see [text](url) keep it as [text](url), not plain text
- Do not modify, shorten, or reformat any URLs, emails, or phone numbers
```

**With New Instructions:**
```python
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. NEVER make up or invent ANY details including program names, services, or contact information
2. ALWAYS include complete URLs exactly as they appear in the search results
3. When you see a URL like https://example.com/page, include the FULL URL
4. If the URL appears as a markdown link [text](url), preserve the markdown format
5. Answer comprehensively with all relevant information including impact data, outcomes, statistics, and research findings. Do NOT add "Next Steps" or "Getting Involved" sections with contact information or action prompts.

RESPONSE FORMATTING - BALANCED APPROACH:
1. START WITH CONTEXT: Begin with 1-2 sentences providing a warm introduction
2. USE STRUCTURE FOR CLARITY: Organize information with clear headings
3. MIX PARAGRAPHS AND LISTS: Use short paragraphs for concepts, bullet points for details
4. NO CALLS-TO-ACTION: Do NOT include action phrases like "Apply here", "Sign up today", "Contact us to get started"
5. USE EMOJIS SPARINGLY: Maximum 2-3 per response, never both emoji and dash as bullet
```

## Rationale

### CTA Strategy Evolution
- **Before:** Bedrock responses included inline CTAs like "Get Involved", "Apply here →", "Make your first donation"
- **After:** Responses focus on information delivery without action prompts
- **Future:** CTA buttons will be injected systematically by `response_enhancer.js` based on conversation context

### Key Benefits
1. **Consistency:** Both streaming and HTTP endpoints now have identical prompt behavior
2. **Separation of Concerns:** Information delivery separate from action prompts
3. **Better UX:** Context-aware button CTAs will replace scattered inline links
4. **Preserved Value:** Impact data, statistics, and outcomes remain in responses

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Deployed to Lambda successfully (Version 9)
2. ✅ Tested with Austin Angels tenant (auc5b0ecb0adcb)
3. ✅ Widget loads correctly showing "Austin Angels"
4. ✅ Responses exclude "Get Involved" sections
5. ✅ Impact data and informational content preserved

### Test Queries Used
- "Tell me about your programs"
- "How can I donate?"
- "I want to volunteer"
- "Tell me about the Love Box program"
